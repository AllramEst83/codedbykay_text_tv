@AGENTS.md

## Claude Code specifics
- `AGENTS.md` is the shared source of truth and is imported above; keep Claude-only notes here, everything else in `AGENTS.md` / `.agents/`.
- Shell is Windows: use the PowerShell or Bash tool with forward-slash paths. The repo root is the Flutter project; run `flutter`/`dart` from there.
- Kotlin and the manifest are not compiled by `flutter test` or `flutter analyze`; run `flutter build apk --debug` after touching `android/`.
- Don't add attribution or extra docs files unless asked; put durable decisions in `.agents/architecture.md` (Decisions log).
